 A Chemical plant has a tank for storing ethanol.
            - When the tank is more than 80% full, it
                 should raise an alarm to close the valve.
            - When the tank is less than 20% full, it
                 should send an SMS to buy more liquid.
            - The total tank capacity is 900 litres.
            - Write a program to simulate this.
            - Ask user to enter current level of ethanol in the tank.
            - Print the appropriate action based on value entered
            - Make sure that your program needs minimum changes
                 for a tank of different capacity

Ask the user to enter a number.
- If the number is a single digit number,
     add 7 to it, and print the number in its unit’s place
- If the number is a two digit number,
    raise the number to the power of 5, 
    and print the number in its unit’s place
- If the number is a three digit number, 
    ask the user to enter another number. 
    Add the 2 numbers and print the number in its unit’s place
Use the solution provided in S03Q01 as the template for this exercises.
- Instead of doing a print to print the final result in "perform_check" function 
call separate functions : 
   do_1digit_oper() and
   do_2digit_oper() and
   do_3digit_oper()
that will perform the required operations based on the number of digits.
